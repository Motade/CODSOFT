# Titanic Survival Prediction
The objective of this project is to create a predictive model using the Titanic dataset. The model will be designed to determine whether a passenger aboard the Titanic survived or perished. This project involves the analysis of historical data related to the Titanic's passengers, and the ultimate goal is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying passengers as survivors or non-survivors based on various input features.
# Sales Prediction
This project aims to leverage Python-based machine learning techniques to analyze historical sales and marketing data. It objectives include enabling data-driven decision-making for advertising cost management, creating predictive models to optimize advertising strategies, and maximizing sales potential by targeting the right audience and platforms. The project strives to provide actionable insights for informed decisions and improved sales performance.
# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project aims to harness Python-based machine learning techniques to effectively identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The process involves comprehensive data preprocessing and normalization, with special attention to addressing class imbalance issues. The dataset is subsequently partitioned into training and testing subsets. A classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, is then trained to classify transactions as either fraudulent or genuine. To assess the model's performance rigorously, key metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score are evaluated. Moreover, various strategies, such as oversampling or undersampling, are explored to further enhance the model's ability to detect fraudulent transactions, ultimately contributing to improved fraud detection and enhanced financial security.
