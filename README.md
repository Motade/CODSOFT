# Titanic Survival Prediction
The objective of this project is to create a predictive model using the Titanic dataset. The model will be designed to determine whether a passenger aboard the Titanic survived or perished. This project involves the analysis of historical data related to the Titanic's passengers, and the ultimate goal is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying passengers as survivors or non-survivors based on various input features.
